# Linked List

## What is this?

A Linked List (or Doubly Linked List) is a data strcuture made up of "Nodes" in which every Node maintains a reference to the Node that comes after it (and in the case of the Doubly Linked List the one that comes before it as well)

## Why make this?

So I have a place to refer to when reviewing for interviews or I am just interested in the Linked List data structure.

## How do I use this?

- Read the code 
- Run the code 
- Comprehend the code
