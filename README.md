## Why make this?

To have a clear reference point for reviewing algorithms.

## How do I use this?

- Open algorithm of interest project
	- `cd <algorithm-of-interest>`
- Read `README`
	- `cat README.md`
- Read code
	`cat <file-of-interest>.js`
- Run Code
	- node `<file-of-interest>.js`

## Required additions:

- More details in Hash Table README
- Better comments on HashTable `index.js`
