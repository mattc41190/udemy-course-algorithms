# Stack

## What is this?

This is a description of the stack data structure. A stack is a data structure that limits insertion and removal of item to a "first in last out" rule. It consists of nodes added one after (or on top of) the other. 

## Why make this?

Because it is a fundamental data structure and is part of how most programming languages implement their runtime (the "call stack").

## How do I use this?

- Read the two implementations of Stack (in javascript)
- Compare the LinkedList approach to the Array approach
	- Recall, an advantage of the LinkedList approach is that it doesn't have to move a lot of data around on each manipulation to size and deletion.
- Run the programs and modify them to see if they match your expectation
